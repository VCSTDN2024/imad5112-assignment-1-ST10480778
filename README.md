Problems and solutions

Linking both interfaces in my Kotlin file for the input to give me an output 

I fixed it by adding code that will fetch the stored data from the main activity page. 

 

Submitting my commits on GitHub using android studio 

Used command prompt for the commit code. 

 

Variable declaration  

Asked ai to give a skeleton of how to declare my variables. 

 

GitHub action workflow configuration 

Had to change my code
