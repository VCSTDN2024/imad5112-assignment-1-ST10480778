Design Considerations
---
The design of the Meal Application was based on the following key considerations: 

User Experience (UX): The app was designed with the goal of providing an easy to use app that will allow the user to use the applicaation with no confusion , thats its seamless. 

Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user. 

 

GitHub and GitHub Actions 

This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding. 

GitHub Actions: 

I used GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission
